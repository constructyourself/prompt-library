## Sprint Planning & Implementation

### Fibonacci Estimation Explanation
[The Fibonacci estimation scale uses the Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.) to size work items. This scale reflects the inherent uncertainty in estimating larger tasks:

- **1 point**: Trivial task, well understood with virtually no risk
- **2 points**: Simple task, clear solution, minimal risk
- **3 points**: Straightforward task with some complexity
- **5 points**: Moderate complexity, some unknowns
- **8 points**: Complex task with significant unknowns
- **13 points**: Very complex task with high uncertainty
- **21+ points**: Task too large, should be broken down further

Teams use this scale for relative sizing rather than absolute time estimates, as the non-linear progression helps teams acknowledge that larger tasks have disproportionately more uncertainty.]

**Sprint Goal:** [Deliver core reconciliation functionality with basic UI]  
**Sprint Duration:** [2 weeks]  
**Sprint Capacity:** [100 points]
